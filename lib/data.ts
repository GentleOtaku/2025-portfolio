Currently completing my A.S. at Irvine Valley College, I have a guaranteed transfer to UC Irvine in Fall 2025 to pursue my B.S. in Computer Science. I thrive on building impactful projects that bridge technology and user experience. My most notable work includes a Google Cloud x MLB Hackathon project, where I developed a full-stack fan engagement platform using React, Flask, and Tailwind CSS. This app features real-time game schedules, AI-driven multilingual news digests, and a k-means clustering recommendation system. Beyond hackathons, I’ve built a COVID-19 simulation dashboard in Flask, providing intuitive data insights through an interactive UI. My passion lies in leveraging AI and software engineering to create seamless, data-driven experiences. Always open to collaborating on innovative projects and connecting with like-minded engineers!";
