      <p className="mb-3">
        I thrive on building impactful projects that bridge technology and user experience. My most notable work includes a Google Cloud x MLB Hackathon project, where I developed a full-stack fan engagement platform using React, Flask, and Tailwind CSS. This app features real-time game schedules, AI-driven multilingual news digests, and a k-means clustering recommendation system.
        <br/><br/>
        Beyond hackathons, I&apos;ve built a COVID-19 simulation dashboard in Flask, providing intuitive data insights through an interactive UI. My passion lies in leveraging AI and software engineering to create seamless, data-driven experiences. Always open to collaborating on innovative projects and connecting with like-minded engineers!
